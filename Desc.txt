1. Web Server for communicating with raspberry pi to give commands.

2. BT interfacing logic to be written on raspberry pi master for passing commands to the slave circuit.
	-connect with BT module.
	-decide which slave to connect to. -- mapping required on master side
	-decide which device to operate connected to the slave.
